# Prototypal Inheritance Conclusion c

You've now learned about the Prototypal model of Object-Orientation used by
JavaScript, _natively_. These days, most OO JS will be written using `class`
and the ES2016 standard, but you will likely encounter and might well be
interviewed on questions around the Prototypal model.

While the syntax changes, Object-Orientation _does not_. We still use
constructors to pass instance data, we still write methods that have access to
the instance data, we still use objects to help us maintain intelligible code.
***The only difference*** is how you write the class and how you instantiate
the instance.
